Serenity BDD is an open source library that aims to make the idea of living documentation a reality.

Serenity BDD helps you write cleaner and more maintainable automated acceptance and regression tests faster. Serenity also uses the test results to produce illustrated, narrative reports that document and describe what your application does and how it works. Serenity tells you not only what tests have been executed, but more importantly, what requirements have been tested.

One key advantage of using Serenity BDD is that you do not have to invest time in building and maintaining your own automation framework.

Serenity BDD provides strong support for different types of automated acceptance testing, including:

Rich built-in support for web testing with Selenium.

REST API testing with RestAssured.

Highly readable, maintainable and scalable automated testing with the Screenplay pattern.
